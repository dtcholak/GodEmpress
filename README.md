Hello Everyone!

This is going to be to maintain version control and separate feature and testing work from the main (production) version. The goal is to keep the main version as bug-free as possible and not accidentally break things on it. Keeping all the files necessary to edit the game file in Unity here also ensures that people can keep their personal files synced and any changes are documented for reference.

Thanks!
